In clinical settings, therapists are trained to respond quickly and apply Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) protocols effectively. However, parents—despite some limited training—often face overwhelming difficulties in mediating behavioral challenges at home. Unlike therapists, parents must also balance multiple responsibilities, from household care to managing other children, which leaves them with fewer resources and strategies to respond effectively during behavioral outbursts. It is therefore vital for both parents and children to have access to reliable, personalized guidance that can help them navigate difficult situations and foster healthier routines. 

This project introduces a data-driven, interpretable, and deployable ABA recommendation system, unique by several innovations. It is designed to be user friendly, easy to understand, practical and relevant in the field of ABA. Making it easier and more accessible for families, clinicians and care givers to receive the support they need.

## Research Question
How can deep learning and interpretable machine learning be applied to recommend personalized ABA interventions for children with autism, providing caregivers with real-time, evidence-based decision support for at-home behavioral management?
